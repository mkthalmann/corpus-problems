# An experimentalist's perspective on corpus data

This repository contains the slides and the code for some of the simulations and illustrations for a talk I gave on July 11, 2022 in Göttingen.

**Abstract**:

> In this presentation, I would like to discuss various issues surrounding corpus data, mostly guided by my own (experimental) perspective of what makes good data. On the interpretation side, I will argue that corpus data differ from experimental data in important respects, which should modulate both the kind of inferences we draw and the strength of our conclusions. On the statistics side, I will engage with an interesting discussion in the literature where authors — among them Koplenig (2019) — ponder whether inferential (as opposed to descriptive) statistics are an appropriate tool for corpus data in the first place, and what alternatives exist.
